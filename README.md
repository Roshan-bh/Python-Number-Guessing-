                                ##----Game Description---##
                                
This game will give you practical exposure with interactive programs, conditional execution (if/else
statements, for and while loops) methods that return values, text processing, python naming
convention, use Module with import and simple class implementation.

You will be developing a simple and easy to play “Mastermind” game. Mastermind is a two-player code-
breaking game, in which one player hides a code consisting of colors, while the other player has to guess

it using clues given by the former player for each turn.
In this game, you will be creating your own Mastermind Game, a simple version, using Python
Language. In your version of Mastermind, the program will randomly select a three (3) digits secret code
and the user tries to guess it, based on the deterministic clues given by the program. You must guess a
secret three-digit number based on clues.
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Yellow” when your guess has a
correct digit in the wrong place, “Green” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and
“Red” if your guess has no correct digits, and it will not tell you which position it got right. You have 10
tries to guess the secret number.
After a correct guess by the user, the program prompts- if the user wants to play the game again, if the
user chooses not(No)to play again,then program displays the various statistics about the series of games
played by the user as shown in the example log of execution below. Your program output must be
exactly as the example log provided.

~~~ Welcome to Mastermind Game ~~~
Hi gamer, welcome to the Mastermind game
What is your name? Harry
Hello, Harry, Please follow the given instructions to play the game.
~~~GAME INSTRUCTION~~~
I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say: That means:
Yellow One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Green One digit is correct and in the right position.
Red No digit is correct.
For example, if the secret number was 346 and your guess was 843, the
clues would be Green Yellow.'''
